## 🧑‍💻About Me

I’m **Oluwanifemi Dipe**, a **Growth Marketing & Data Analyst** who believes the best marketing doesn’t guess, it listens to the data and keeps learning.

To me, real growth comes from truly understanding people: **what captures their attention, what builds their trust, what turns interest into action**... and then building smart, repeatable systems to reach more of them at the right time.

With strong skills in **Excel, Power BI, SQL, and Python**, I take raw, messy data and turn it into **clear, trustworthy insights that marketing teams** can actually use to move the needle.

My mission is simple:  
**Bridge the gap between data and growth** — making complex numbers simple, human, and ready to drive decisions.

## 🚶‍➡️ **My Journey**

I started out deeply curious about businesses:  
**What do they really want? How can they get it? What do they fear, and how can they reduce the risk?**

Those early questions and experiments taught me one big lesson:  
Teams don’t just need more sales, revenue, or engagement.  
They need to know *what’s actually working*, what isn’t, *why*, and how to make it better tomorrow.

That’s when I thought about combining **Data Analytics and Marketing**. It brings together data, psychology, and creativity in a way that creates real, measurable impact.

Today, my day-to-day usually looks like this:

- Cleaning and structuring data so everyone can trust the numbers  
- Building and analysing dashboards that clearly answer *Who, What, Why, and How*  
- Writing SQL queries to uncover deeper insights from databases  
- Translating findings into simple, actionable recommendations that marketing, business, and product teams can implement right away
